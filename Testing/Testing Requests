If you make any updates to the MCTS Algorithms or create new eval functions / pruning methods / whatever and you want somebody to
run tests on it, put your requests in here. Obviously be as specific as needed, e.g.:

Pruned MCTS with return most visited, 3 seconds thinking vs. Pruned MCTS with return most visited, 3 seconds thinking
Black with Pruning factor 1, 3, 7, 10                    vs. White with constant Pruning factor 5

or something like this.
If you have time to kill or you're leaving your PC (because you're going out for the night, going on an appartment cleaning binge,
going to the gym, whatever), check if there are testing requests and set your PC to testing before you go.
That way we can get way more results in. This will especially be relevant in the last week, when we need loads of data to have good
visualizations for the presentation. :)

When you have Testing Results to share, just upload them into the Backgaymmon/Testing folder.
